used car price predictor using machine learning


## objective

The primary objective of the Used Car Price Predictor project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features


## steps

1. clean the imported data
2. performed EDA for identifying distribution, outliers, checking realatioship
3. handles null values
4. seleted best features using multiple feature selection techniques
5. select the best model
6. deploy model using streamlit app using AWs
